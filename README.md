### Game Idea 1: The Curious Labyrinth
  A single-player survival and action game that rqeuires the player to escape the dungeon he was placed in, by completing a series of mazes. Each level / maze requires finding the a number of key items that would unlock the gate to the next level. The said key items are guarded by monsters that need to be eliminated first before acquiring the key item. The difficulty scales at each level, where at aevery 5 levels, the player must defeat a boss monster to unlock the gate.
  The game provides the player an initial set of items to use. Other game items, such as potions, weapons, and shields, will be scattered all over the maze. Using each of the weapon items will consume a number of stamina points depending on the difficulty level of the weapon. Consumable items will help regain health and stamina points. Also, experience points will be provided at every monster defeated by the player, which will be used to level up the player, i.e., give the player more health and stamina points.
